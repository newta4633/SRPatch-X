# SRPatch X 🔪

[SRPatch X](https://github.com/KhunHtetzNaing/SRPatch-X) is a modern Android APK signature
verification bypass tool featuring multiple hooking techniques:

- **Package Manager Hooking (PMS Hook)** - Intercepts signature checks at the system service level
- **File System Hooking (IO Hook)** - Blocks signature verification through direct file access
- **Supervisor Call Hooking (SVC Hook)** - Bypasses checks at the kernel system call level

## Features

- [x] Multiple signature bypass methods with configurable strength levels
- [x] Modern Material Design 3 UI
- [x] Path redirection for advanced protection
- [ ] APK signing capabilities with custom keystore support

## Note

**SRPatch X** is an extended version of **SRPatch** (`com.lingxing.srpatch`), originally developed
by **LingXing**. Since the original SRPatch is no longer maintained and its
website ([srpatch.cc](https://srpatch.cc/)) is offline, I've preserved the core functionality by
extracting `libSRPatch.so` and building this application around it.

**Enhancements over original SRPatch:**

- Added APK signing features
- Improved stability and compatibility

**Copyright Notice:**  
I do not own the "SRPatch" name or the `libSRPatch` core library. All rights remain with the
original developer, LingXing.

**Purpose:**  
Initially created for personal use, I'm sharing SRPatch X publicly for Android security researchers
and developers who may benefit from these tools.
